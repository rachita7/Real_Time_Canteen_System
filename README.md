# üç¥ Real-Time Canteen Information System  

Academic Project for CE1003 Introduction to Computational Thinking (NTU)

**For NTU North Spine Food Court**  

This project involves the development of a real-time information system for the NTU North Spine Food Court, designed to help users access important details about the food stalls in the canteen. Built using Python and the **PyQt5** GUI toolkit, the system provides real-time information about stall availability, opening and closing times, menus, and estimated waiting times based on user input.

## üìã Features
- **Stall Information**: Displays information such as the **opening and closing times** of each food stall in the NTU North Spine Food Court.
- **Availability Check**: Allows users to check if a stall is available at a specific, user-defined **date and time**.
- **Menu Display**: Shows the **menu** of the selected stall.
- **Estimated Waiting Time**: Calculates the estimated **waiting time** for a stall based on the **number of people** in the queue, input by the user.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Designed with **PyQt5** for an intuitive and responsive interface.

## üí° Project Details

- **GUI Framework**: The application is built using **PyQt5**, a popular Python binding for the Qt application framework, known for its ease of use and structured framework.
- **Estimated Waiting Time**: The system calculates waiting time based on an estimated number of people in the queue, helping users plan their visits accordingly.
